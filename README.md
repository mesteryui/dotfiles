# Hello

These are my personal dotfiles, includes neovim, sway, etc...

## Plugins of neovim

The plugins of my neovim config are in the file

These are my dotfiles, I think that is some strange but for me is good I think.

I think my main configuration will be in [Disroot Git](git.disroot.org) but my neovim config it'll be in disroot yet.
